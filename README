Single phase power analyser.

This is an effort to create a simple and affordable power analyser for single phase opearation.

* Measurement circuit:
 
Voltage: transformer -> capacitor -> resistor divider

Current: ACS758-050B -> OP284 gain stage (for resolution enchancement)

* Compilation:

This code will compile with GCC ARM embedded suite https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
